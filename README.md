# central-limit-theorem
 
## Introduction
In this notebook, we will be demonstrating the central limit theorem by conducting analyses on samples of a predefined population. Please visit www.mathieutorchia.com to read an article about the findings from this python notebook.

## Jupyter Notebook Code

### Importing Packages
Simply importing the necessary packages.

### Population Creation
We create a population of size 1,000,000, where each "person" is assigned a value between 0 and 10. We also visualize this through the use of a histogram.

### Sampling Distribution
We explore the differences in the sampling distribution depending on the sample size that is used.
